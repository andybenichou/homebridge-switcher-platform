## Description

The long waited plugin for the Switcher accessories is here!<br>
Easily discovers your device automatically without any prior steps needed.<br>
**NO configuration needed, NO extraction of values or params, NO use of external scripts and method.**

The plugin will automatically expose all your Switcher devices and add them to HomeKit.

## Version 4 - \*\*BREAKING CHANGES\*\*

Version 4 includes the following improvements:

- **Support for Switcher Runner (blinds/roller-shutter)**
- Added [Custom Timers](###custom-timers) - The ability to create virtual switches that will turn on your boiler for X minutes
- Automatically detect device types and match with default icon: Boiler > Water Valve, Power Plug > Outlet, Switcher Runner > Window Covering
- Removed duration from 'Power Plug' devices
- Removed default 'Accessory Type' for all devices
- Changed plugin name to homebridge-switcher-platform
- Added power consumption tracking for all accessories (Eve app only)

Some things changed in the plugin that might break the way it works for you, you might need to uninstall and reinstall the plugin which will lead to removal of the accessories and the need to recreate scenes and automations - BE WARNED!

# Advanced Control

## Auto Detect Configurations & Multiple Accessories

The plugin will scan and listen for messages from all your Switcher devices. When a message is received from a new Switcher device, the plugin will automatically add it to HomeKit in it's default icon and functionality <br>
**Power Plug** => Outlet <br>
**Boiler** => Water Valve <br>
**Runner** => Window Covering (type cannot be changed)

To change the device icon and functionality continue reading...

## Advanced Config

As mentioned above, the plugin will automatically add all devices as Switch Accessories (unless mentioned otherwise in the config under it's default type)

it's possible to set specific icon for a specific device.
To achieve that you'll need to add `devices` to your config.

Example:

``` json
"platforms": [
    {
      "platform": "SwitcherPlatform",
      "devices": [
        {
          "identifier": "e4eaf6",
          "accessoryType": "outlet",
          "hide": false
        }
      ]
    }
]
```

###### * `"identifier"` is required for custom device settings

### Identifier

Identifier is required for the plugin to know what device you want to change settings for.

To do that, you'll need to supply one of the following:

1. Device ID - Can be found in the plugin logs or can be extracted via python scripts that are out there in the WWW.
2. Device IP - Device IP address. Must be static if you're using this method.
3. Device Name - Exactly as it's written in Switcher app.

Set any of the above as `"identifier"`. Example:

``` json
"platforms": [
    {
      "platform": "SwitcherPlatform",
      "devices": [
        {
          "identifier": "e4eaf6",
          "accessoryType": "outlet"
        },
        {
          "identifier": "10.0.0.1",
          "accessoryType": "switch",
        },
        {
          "identifier": "Boiler",
          "accessoryType": "valve"
        }
      ]
    }
]
```

### Hide

If you wish to exclude a Switcher device from HomeKit, just add `"hide": true` to your device config.

Example:

``` json
"platforms": [
    {
      "platform": "SwitcherPlatform",
      "devices": [
        {
          "identifier": "e4eaf6",
          "hide": true
        }
      ]
    }
]
```

### Accessory Type

Changing accessory type can change the icon the functionality.<br>
`accessoryType` can be define in the device custom settings level.

When a new device is discovered it will first look if `accessoryType` is defined in `devices` with it's own `identifier`, if not, it will use it's default.

Custom accessory type for a device:

``` json
"platforms": [
    {
      "platform": "SwitcherPlatform",
      "devices": [
        {
          "identifier": "e4eaf6",
          "accessoryType": "outlet"
        }
      ]
    }
]
```

\* Switcher Runner (blinds) accessory type, cannot be changed

#### Switch (default)
When you just want a normal switch (like version 1) and don't need anything else. (all [extra services](###extras) will still appear in 3rd party apps)

Choosing switch will also track your power consumption.<br>
**Eve app only**: history and stats and will even calculate yearly costs after it collected enough data.

Read more about it [here](###extras)

#### Outlet
Choose `"accessoryType": "outlet"` if you are most interested in the power consumption stats and automations. Outlet accessory will reveal the service "In Use" which will only be active if your boiler is ON and consume energy. it will not be active when the boiler has reached it's temperature limit and no power is used (even if the switcher is ON -  accessory will show on but not "in use").<br>
Choosing outlet will also track your power consumption.<br>
**Eve app only**: history and stats and will even calculate yearly costs after it collected enough data.

Read more about it [here](###extras)


#### Water Valve
Choosing `"accessoryType": "valve"` will give you the possibility to control your auto-shutdown time from the Home app and therefore affect the time the device will be on before forcing shutdown.

Since version 3, The plugin manage it's own "Auto Shutdown" duration. Now you are able to set any amount of time between 1 minute to 23:59 hours.
Next time you'll turn on the switcher from the Home App it will be turned ON only for the amount of time you've set in HomeKit.

Choosing valve will also track your power consumption.<br>
**Eve app only**: history and stats and will even calculate yearly costs after it collected enough data.

Read more about it [here](###extras)
### Extras

Since version 1.1.0 there are a lot more exciting options for your Switcher!
First of all, I've added a lot of services to support both timer/auto-shutdown and getting information about the power consumption of the device.

All the new services are available for any accessory type that you choose (in Eve app or most of 3rd party apps).
However, in Home app it is not possible to present an accessory with all those functionalities, especially since it doesn't support power consumption.

To overcome this limit I gave you the possibility to choose what would be the best option for you to see in Home app.

### New Services and Eve App

Since version 1.1, a lot of new services are available in Eve app.<br>
check the following screenshot and explanations:<br><br>
<img src="branding/eve_screenshot.jpeg" width="300px"><br>

*To reveal all the services, click on "Edit" in Eve app (top right in the accessory screen) and enable everything.

**In Use (Outlet only)** - Represent wether or not the boiler is heating and consuming energy.<br>
**Consumption** - Current consumption in Watts.<br>
**Current** - Electrical current (Ampere).<br>
**Voltage** - Always 220 volt when device is ON.<br>
**Projected Cost** - Eve calculations of predicted yearly cost based on Total consumption.<br>
**Total Consumption** - Total Consumption in kWh.<br>
**Total Cost** - Eve calculations of total costs with local currency.<br>
**Default Duration** - Auto-Shutdown time, affecting the Auto-Shutdown setting in Switcher app and the max heating duration. possible inputs are between 1 hour to 23:59 hours<br>
**Remaining** - Shows the remaining time until the boiler will shut off<br>


### Custom Timers

Since Version 4 of this plugin you can create virtual switches that will turn on your boiler for X minutes. 2 seconds after turning on the boiler, the virtual switch will turn off automatically (and will not represent the state of the boiler).

This is very useful, especially since the iOS 14 bug that prevents you from setting the duration in the Home app.

Custom timers for a device:

``` json
"platforms": [
    {
      "platform": "SwitcherPlatform",
      "customTimers": [
        {
          "identifier": "24eaf5",
          "shutdownMinutes": 30
        },
        {
          "identifier": "24eaf5",
          "shutdownMinutes": 60
        }
      ]
    }
]
```

\* Only for Boiler

## Issues & Debug

### I can see status but I can't control

Check that you have the latest firmware installed and that your homebridge machine clock is accurate.
If you have the latest firmware version installed and it still not working, try to set "Local" mode in Switcher app and turn your device on and off from the switcher app in this mode. you can then remove "Local" mode and the switcher should be controllable again from HomeKit in a few minutes (up to 30 min).

### When using valve, I can't add the device to scenes and automations

Home app does not allow water devices to be part of scenes and automations, use a 3rd party app like "Eve" to add this device to automations or scenes.

### My Switcher is not showing up in HomeKit

Please verify that your Switcher device is connected to the network and under the same subnet as Homebridge.
